My simple and professional Test Plan Documented and tailoredtailored fot the BackEnd project using Jest and Supertest:
Test Plan for Backend API

1. Overview
   The test plan outlines the approach for validating the core functionality of the backend API developed in Node.js using Express. The backend handles user authentication and task management. Testing is focused on ensuring both expected (positive) and unexpected (negative) behaviors are handled correctly.

2. What is Being Tested
   Authentication APIs

Login with valid and invalid credentials

Task Management APIs

Create a new task

Retrieve all tasks

Update existing task

Delete a task

3. Test Coverage Areas
   Area Test Cases
   Auth - Login success

- Login failure (wrong credentials)
  Create Task - Create with valid input
  Read Tasks - Get all tasks
  Update Task - Update valid task
- Update non -existent task
  Delete Task - Delete valid task

4. Tools Used and Why
   Tool Purpose
   Jest JavaScript testing framework for unit/integration testing
   Supertest To simulate HTTP requests to API endpoints
   Node.js + Express The backend runtime and framework being tested

5. How to Run the Tests
   Install dependencies:
   npm install

6. Run tests:
   npm test
